# Website Animations Showcase with Framer Motion

This project is a showcase of interactive animations implemented using Framer Motion. The goal was to replicate and enhance animations from a website using React, TypeScript, Next.js, and Framer Motion. This demonstration highlights my ability to quickly learn new libraries and implement high-quality, interactive elements in a modern web application.

## Features Implemented

- Header Scroll Animation:

  - The header is animated to show or hide based on the Y-axis scroll position. This enhances the user experience by maintaining focus on the page content while allowing quick access to navigation when needed.

- Hero Section Text Animation:

  - Implemented a smooth letter-by-letter fade-in effect for the hero section text as the user scrolls. This dynamic entrance adds a polished feel to the hero section, drawing the userâ€™s attention to key information.

- Infinite Loop Icon Carousel
  - Created a horizontal, infinite loop of sliding icons. This animation provides a modern, dynamic visual to display partners, clients, or key features in an engaging way.

## Tech Stack

- React with TypeScript: Provides a strong foundation for type-safe component-based architecture.
- Next.js: Utilized to manage server-side rendering and routing.
- Framer Motion: Employed to handle the animations with a declarative and efficient approach.
- MUI: Leveraged MUI's Box and Typography components for consistent styling and responsive design.

## Purpose

This project was developed to demonstrate my ability to learn new tools quickly and deliver high-quality work in a short timeframe. Prior to this, I had no experience with Framer Motion but quickly grasped the essentials and implemented these animations to align with SAFE's project requirements.
